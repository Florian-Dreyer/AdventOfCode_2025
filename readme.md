# Advent of Code 2025 — My solutions

This repository contains my solutions for **[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)**.  
Each day includes:

- An input file in CSV format  
- A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with solutions to both puzzles

## Structure

```
.
├── input/
│   ├── day_x.csv
│   ├── day_y.csv
│   └── ...
├── day_x.ipynb
├── day_y.ipynb
├── ...
...
```

## Notes

- Notebooks contain the solutions for Part 1 and Part 2.
- Inputs are stored as CSV files for consistent loading but are not included in the repository as it is not allowed to redistribute the input.
- Any standard Jupyter setup can run the notebooks.
